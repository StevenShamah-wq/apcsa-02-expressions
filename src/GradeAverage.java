 * Exercise 10 (Homework) — GradeAverage
 *
 * Four categories with different weights. Compute the weighted
 * average and print it to one decimal place.
 *
 *   Homework   15%
 *   Classwork  25%
 *   Tests      25%
 *   Project    25%
 *   Participation 10%
 *
 * (Yes — these are this course's actual weights. Use them to
 *  work out what your own grade would be.)
